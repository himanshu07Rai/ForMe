# Library vs Framework

Libraries and frameworks **are code that someone else wrote** to help us solve common problems while writing our application.



## Libraries

Libraries are to solve a specific problem in our app. For example:

- Routing
- Dates management
- Transform data

## Frameworks

It **can be everything you use** to develop your web app. Typically is a collection of libraries that work together in some opinionated way to help you build a fully functioning app.

#### Some popular JavaScript frameworks

- Angular: provide routing, fetching data, components, testing, and more
- Nuxt.js: same as Next.js but instead of Reactjs, uses Vue
- Express.js: is NodeJS framework for the server

## Reactjs vs. Nextjs

React is a **JavaScript library** that helps us to build user interfaces using components as building blocks.

**Reactjs do one part** of all the web app, which is to build UI components to show content.

**NextJS is a framework** with a set of libraries that work together to build a web app, and one of those libraries is Reactjs.

` React is used by Nextjs not only to create components in the UI but to build full pages. `

### Other libraries used by Nextjs are:

- next/router for routing and navigation
- next/link a component that allows our web app to link pages and lazy load data
- next/image a component to load images into the pages in the most performant way
