# ASGI vs WSGI: A Comparison

## Overview
| Feature      | WSGI                                      | ASGI                                      |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Full Form    | Web Server Gateway Interface              | Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface     |
| Purpose      | Standard interface for synchronous web apps | Standard interface for asynchronous web apps |
| Protocol     | Synchronous HTTP                          | Asynchronous HTTP, WebSocket, and more    |
| Use Case     | Traditional web frameworks (e.g., Django, Flask) | Modern asynchronous frameworks (e.g., FastAPI, Starlette) |

## Key Differences

### 1. **Synchronous vs Asynchronous**
- **WSGI**:
  - Built for synchronous web applications.
  - Handles one request at a time per worker process/thread.
  - Not designed to support modern protocols like WebSocket.

- **ASGI**:
  - Designed for asynchronous applications.
  - Supports handling multiple requests concurrently.
  - Natively supports WebSocket, HTTP2, and other modern protocols.

### 2. **Concurrency**
- **WSGI**:
  - Relies on multithreading or multiprocessing for concurrency.
  - Blocking I/O operations can hinder performance under heavy load.

- **ASGI**:
  - Leverages Python's asynchronous capabilities (`asyncio`).
  - Non-blocking, allowing for higher throughput and better performance.

### 3. **Protocol Support**
- **WSGI**:
  - Limited to HTTP 1.x.
  - Incompatible with protocols like WebSocket.

- **ASGI**:
  - Supports HTTP, WebSocket, HTTP2, and other asynchronous protocols.
  - More suitable for real-time applications.

### 4. **Adoption**
- **WSGI**:
  - Widely adopted by older frameworks like Django, Flask, and Pyramid.
  - Stable and reliable for traditional web applications.

- **ASGI**:
  - Preferred for modern frameworks like FastAPI, Starlette, and Django (with `channels` for asynchronous support).
  - Growing adoption for real-time and event-driven applications.

## When to Use Which?
| Use Case                              | Recommended Interface |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Traditional, synchronous applications | WSGI                  |
| Real-time applications (e.g., chat apps) | ASGI                  |
| Applications requiring WebSocket       | ASGI                  |
| Heavy concurrent workloads            | ASGI                  |
| Existing WSGI-based project           | WSGI (or hybrid approach) |

## Examples of Frameworks
| Framework       | Interface Supported |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Django (default) | WSGI                |
| Flask            | WSGI                |
| FastAPI          | ASGI                |
| Starlette        | ASGI                |
| Django Channels  | ASGI                |

---

## Summary
- **WSGI**: Ideal for traditional, synchronous web applications.
- **ASGI**: The future of Python web development, enabling asynchronous capabilities and support for modern protocols.
